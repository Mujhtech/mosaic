# Protocol changelog

All notable Mosaic protocol changes are recorded here. Versioned artifacts are
not immutable until their review gate is approved.

## Local Preview 0.1 - 2026-07-17

Status: frozen Phase 2 integration contract; Phase 2 review pending

- Added a separate, platform-neutral Local Preview `0.1` WebSocket envelope
  without changing approved Paywall Protocol `0.1` RC1 semantics.
- Defined editable document identities, ordered local revisions, preview client
  identity, exact first-party preview capabilities, acknowledgements,
  heartbeats, validation errors, compatibility warnings, render failures, and
  bounded safe diagnostics with recovery actions.
- Defined local mock subscription and non-consumable products, availability,
  trials, introductory offers, deterministic purchase/restore outcomes, and
  mock entitlement state without introducing a real billing provider model.
- Added a closed local-project autosave schema and normative raw Protocol `0.1`
  JSON import/export rules.
- Added generated message and project fixtures plus validation, correlation,
  stale-revision, mock-commerce, safety, and import/export tests.
- Added a browser-safe canonical validation and generated TypeScript type
  surface for Studio, with browser/Node semantic-parity and generation-drift
  tests. This is an integration surface over the frozen schemas, not a schema
  or paywall-semantics change.

## 0.1 RC1 - 2026-07-16

Status: approved and immutable; product-owner approval recorded 2026-07-17

- Replaced the Phase 0 minimal decoder fixture with the single complete Phase
  1 fixture at `fixtures/v0.1/complete-paywall.json`.
- Added vertical scrolling, recursive vertical stacks, logical spacing,
  direction-relative alignment, safe-area behavior, and deterministic image
  aspect semantics.
- Finalized the RC1 component set: text, image, feature list, product selector,
  purchase button, restore button, close button, and legal text.
- Added document locale catalogs with exact, base-language, fallback-locale,
  default-locale, and inline-default resolution, including long German and
  Arabic RTL coverage.
- Added provider-neutral product references. Localized price, period, offer,
  and trial data remain purchase-provider runtime data.
- Added bundled logical image keys and mandatory localized placeholder
  fallback behavior; no remote asset retrieval is part of Phase 1.
- Added closed declarative purchase, restore, and close actions plus required
  component-specific accessibility metadata.
- Added exact capability metadata, reader/runtime fallback policies, normalized
  interaction outcomes, and normalized presentation outcomes.
- Added recursive capability derivation and semantic validation for duplicate
  IDs, asset/product/action references, locale catalogs, unused declarations,
  canonical fixture coverage, and canonical JSON.
- Expanded protocol validation to 63 valid and invalid contract tests.

## 0.1 Phase 0 draft - 2026-07-16

- Added the initial minimal paywall schema, compatibility manifest, vertical
  decoder fixture, validation tools, documentation, and numeric boundary rules.
