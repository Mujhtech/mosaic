# Protocol changelog

All notable Mosaic protocol changes are recorded here. Versioned artifacts are
not immutable until their review gate is approved.

## 0.1 RC1 - 2026-07-16

Status: release candidate; product-owner approval pending

- Replaced the Phase 0 minimal decoder fixture with the single complete Phase
  1 fixture at `fixtures/v0.1/complete-paywall.json`.
- Added vertical scrolling, recursive vertical stacks, logical spacing,
  direction-relative alignment, safe-area behavior, and deterministic image
  aspect semantics.
- Finalized the RC1 component set: text, image, feature list, product selector,
  purchase button, restore button, close button, and legal text.
- Added document locale catalogs with exact, base-language, fallback-locale,
  default-locale, and inline-default resolution, including long German and
  Arabic RTL coverage.
- Added provider-neutral product references. Localized price, period, offer,
  and trial data remain purchase-provider runtime data.
- Added bundled logical image keys and mandatory localized placeholder
  fallback behavior; no remote asset retrieval is part of Phase 1.
- Added closed declarative purchase, restore, and close actions plus required
  component-specific accessibility metadata.
- Added exact capability metadata, reader/runtime fallback policies, normalized
  interaction outcomes, and normalized presentation outcomes.
- Added recursive capability derivation and semantic validation for duplicate
  IDs, asset/product/action references, locale catalogs, unused declarations,
  canonical fixture coverage, and canonical JSON.
- Expanded protocol validation to 63 valid and invalid contract tests.

## 0.1 Phase 0 draft - 2026-07-16

- Added the initial minimal paywall schema, compatibility manifest, vertical
  decoder fixture, validation tools, documentation, and numeric boundary rules.
